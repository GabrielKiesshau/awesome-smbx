* [Albatoss](https://www.supermariobrosx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=23775) - It'll fly forward in the direction its heading forever, ridable and passing through terrain just like SMB2. In addition, it is a container and can carry any NPC. It'll drop it's payload when a player is in a short distance in front of it.
* [Alive Weapons. Customizable shooting NPCs.](https://www.supermariobrosx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=22107) - The API aliveweapons.lua aims to make most projectile-thrower NPCs into real guns for fighting into levels!
* [Beetroot Powerup](https://www.supermariobrosx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=17989) - It's the beetroot power-up from Mario Forever. With this powerup, you can throw beetroot and they will bounce 2 times, left and right.

* [Conveyor Walls](https://www.supermariobrosx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=24042) - Player can boost up vertically! Also you can press Jump or Altjump button to boost up even more. It even works with NPCs (well actually it works only with SMB3 Goomba, Grand-Goomba and SMW Spiny, but you can change those stuff in code).
* [customblockanim.lua](https://www.supermariobrosx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=23899) - This script lets you customize blocks kinda like you would customise NPCs, BGOs and effects in txt files.
* [Eating Vine Heads](https://www.supermariobrosx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=24117) - Vine heads that replicate Super Mario World's more closely, eating blocks that don't block their path - and solid blocks, too, if they're directly above where they spawn! They'll also eat NPCs like coins, and can be configured to eat a lot more or a lot less. Comes in regular, mutant, and player-controlled variations.

* [Grinder](https://www.supermariobrosx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=24023) - This is the large Grinder from Super Mario World. You cannot jump on them in any capacity unless you have a Boot or Yoshi.
